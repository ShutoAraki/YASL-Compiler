# YASL Compiler
This repository is created for CSC426: Compilers class at DePauw University taught by Dr. Brian Howard in Fall 2018.
YASL (Yet Another Simple Language), a simplified programming language created for pedagogical purposes, will be compiled. The textbook used in this class is available [here](https://moodle.depauw.edu/pluginfile.php/326533/mod_resource/content/1/basics_of_compiler_design.pdf) for free. This documentation will describe the steps toward building a compiler from scratch.

## Lexical Analysis
"This is the initial part of reading and analysing the program text: The text is read and divided into tokens, each of which corresponds to a symbol in the programming language, e.g., a variable name, keyword or number" (Ã†gidius Mogensen, 2).

Example input in YASL
```
program demo1;
/* Declare some constants */
val x = 6;
val y = 7;
begin
  print x * y // should print 42
end.
```
Expected output
```
PROGRAM 1:1
ID demo1 1:9
SEMI 1:14
VAL 3:1
ID x 3:5
ASSIGN 3:7
NUM 6 3:9
SEMI 3:10
VAL 4:1
ID y 4:5
ASSIGN 4:7
NUM 7 4:9
SEMI 4:10
BEGIN 5:1
PRINT 6:3
ID x 6:9
STAR 6:11
ID y 6:13
END 7:1
PERIOD 7:4
EOF 8:1
```

For example, the following Deterministic Finite State Transducer ([FST](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/classes/120/spring13/eric-transducers.pdf)) diagram helps with coding the `NUM` token type.
